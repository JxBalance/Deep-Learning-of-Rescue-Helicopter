# Deep-Learning-of-Rescue-Helicopter
Using Unity Agent to build the scene and model. Using deep learning to train the helicopter conduting maritime rescue.

Firstly, this project analyzes the characteristics of different grades of maritime accidents, and studies the complete task flow of the helicopter marine rescue. On this basis, a maritime rescue simulation scenario was built in Unity3D, and a helicopter flight control program that can be used for simulation was written based on C# language. 
Then, the project construct the neural network structure and write the neural network program based on Python language. This program can not only accept the training data with tags, realize the automatic iterative updating of parameters, but also calculate the manipulated quantity according to the state quantity to realize the application of neural network. After training the neural network, the learned parameters are applied to real-time decision-making and dynamic simulation based on Socket network communication.
